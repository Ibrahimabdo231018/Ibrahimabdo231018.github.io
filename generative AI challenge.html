    <h1>The generative AI challenge</h1>
    <p>Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model capable of generating detailed images based on text 
      descriptions.
       In this challenge we tried to do generate 2D game assets models  using fine-tune Stable Diffusion model
      we choosed the item SWORD to generate and we had to follow some steps</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Study how diffusion models work.<li>
        <li>2. Select a fine-tuning method to use in this challenge.<li>
        <li>3. Create a dataset of game assets.<li>
        </li>4. Fine-tune a stable diffusion model with your dataset.<li>
        <li>5. Evaluate the results. <li>
          </ul>
          <p>at first we understand how the model should work and then we saw a couple of methods to fine-tune the model we chosed 
            Guide to Generate Infinite Game Assets by Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, we created a dataset of game assets and then we fine-tuned the model with the dataset and then we evaluated the results.
           it was a wholesome chance to do all this  </p>
    <p>Here are some of the results:</p>
